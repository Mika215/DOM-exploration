# DOM-exploration
----------------------

The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document.
This is my first full DOM exploration challenge(`learning by doing`).
This repo is comprised of 7 series of challenges which enabled me to aquire a fundamental skill in the `DOM`.
You are warmly welcome to clone and check the codes that i have demonstrated in this repository.
Constructive comments and suggestions are most welcome.
